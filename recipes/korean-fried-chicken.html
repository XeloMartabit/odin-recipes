            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup (85g) gochujang</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons (45g) ketchup</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (30g) mirin</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (30g) dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (30g) honey</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15g) brown sugar</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, grated</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15g) rice vinegar</li>
                <li>Toasted sesame seeds for garnish</li>
                <li>1 bunch, green onion, thinly sliced</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl add chicken, salt, black pepper, and ginger, and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>In a separate medium mixing bowl, combine marinated chicken and cornstarch. Toss by hand to evenly coat chicken, shaking off excess starch before frying.</li>
            <li>Fill a 6 quart Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot with vegetable oil and heat to 320°F (160°C). Once the oil is hot, add the chicken, working in batches, and fry, stirring occasionally, for 3-5 minutes or until golden brown.  Using a spider, transfer chicken to a wire rack lined baking tray to drain off excess oil, allow to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooling, in a small saucepan over medium high heat, add gochujang, ketchup, mirin, dark soy sauce, honey, and brown sugar and bring to a light boil.  Reduce your sauce for one minute, stirring often. Cut the heat and fold in the grated garlic and rice vinegar.</li>
            <li>Over medium heat, increase the temperature of the oil in your Dutch oven to 375°F (190°C). Once the oil is hot, add the chicken, working in batches, and fry, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown and crunchy.  Using a spider, transfer chicken to a large mixing bowl, followed by your sauce, and toss to combine. Plate and garnish with toasted sesame seeds and thinly sliced green onion. Serve and enjoy.</li>
